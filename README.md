# Users App


## About

Presented App is built for Sweeft Digital as a technical homework.It demonstrates possibility to view users 
list (image, name, lastname, email, address and etc) and friends list of a specific user.

 
## My Process

Build with React. Used functional components and hooks to render UI. Since users and friends lists were quite many,
fetched data part by part. Used infinite scroll logic(after the page is fully scrolled, fetches data from the next page
until users' quantity run out). Created custom hook, to use it's logic in different parts of the application. After clicking
on each user, displays user's full info(used react router with params) and it's friends list.
